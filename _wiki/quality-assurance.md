# Quality Assurance in DO-178C

## Introduction

Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is a critical oversight function in DO-178C that ensures compliance with established plans, standards, and processes throughout the software development lifecycle. Unlike traditional quality control that focuses on product defects, DO-178C SQA emphasizes process assuranceâ€”verifying that processes are followed correctly to produce high-quality, safe software.

## Purpose and Objectives

### Regulatory Requirements

DO-178C Section 8 specifically addresses software quality assurance, requiring:

- Assurance that software development and verification processes comply with approved plans
- Authority to ensure corrective actions are implemented
- Independence from the development and verification activities being monitored
- Objective evidence of compliance with plans and standards
- Assurance that deviations are detected, recorded, evaluated, tracked, and resolved

### Benefits of Effective Quality Assurance

1. **Process Compliance**: Ensures adherence to defined processes
2. **Early Problem Detection**: Identifies issues before they impact certification
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Drives process refinement
4. **Certification Confidence**: Provides evidence for certification authorities
5. **Risk Reduction**: Mitigates development and certification risks
6. **Quality Culture**: Promotes quality awareness throughout the organization

## Quality Assurance Activities
