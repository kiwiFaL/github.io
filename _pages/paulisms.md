These are my catch phrases and pithy sayings that I use regularly, half humour half with shallow useful meaning. They encapsulate my philosophy and approach to software development, engineering and general life.

## The Collection

- **"Directionally Correct"** - Progress in the right direction is valuable, even if the solution isn't quite perfect yet.

- **"Single Point of Success"** - Flipping single point of failure in a positive light.

- **"Test is Best"** - Emphasizing the critical importance of thorough testing in engineering, software development, especially for safety-critical systems. We spend days on analysis, trying to save hours of testing.  

- **"As Good as Two Men on Leave"** - yep.

- **"I'm Here to Lead Not Read"** - Lazy leadership, said in a mocking way. Too many leaders listen and hear what they want to hear instead of reading the data. 

- **"Perfect is Enemy of Good"** - Perfect never leaves your desk, get it as close to good as possible and then get in front of someone else to use or review. 

- **"I Can't Explain Quality, but I'll Know It When I See It"** - Sometimes you just have to make something for people to know its wrong and then they will tell you what needs to change to make it right. You need a starting point and then iterate from there. 

- **"Software is an Amazing Technology, Just Don't Use It for Anything Important"** - A tongue-in-cheek commentary on the inherent challenges and limitations of software in critical systems. 

- **"It's not about the principle, it's about the money."** - Flip on the original saying, as this is what most people actually think.

## Context

These sayings often come up in discussions about software development processes, certification activities, and team collaboration. They represent years of experience working with aviation software and certification standards.

Feel free to adopt these Paulisms in your own work if they resonate with you! Be careful some can cut deep.
