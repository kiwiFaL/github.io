# Paulisms

These are my catch phrases and pithy sayings that I use regularly. They encapsulate my philosophy and approach to software development, particularly in the aviation certification context.

## The Collection

- **"Directionally Correct"** - Progress in the right direction is valuable, even if the solution isn't perfect yet.

- **"Single Point of Success"** - Creating systems where success is the natural outcome rather than relying on avoiding multiple failure points.

- **"Test is Best"** - Emphasizing the critical importance of thorough testing in software development, especially for safety-critical systems.

- **"As Good as Two Men on Leave"** - A humorous way to describe something that's not particularly helpful or effective.

- **"I'm Here to Lead Not Read"** - Emphasizing the importance of leadership and decision-making over excessive documentation review.

- **"Perfect is Enemy of Good"** - Recognizing that pursuing perfection can prevent timely delivery of good, functional solutions.

- **"I Can't Explain Quality, but I'll Know It When I See It"** - Acknowledging the sometimes intuitive nature of quality assessment in software.

- **"Software is an Amazing Technology, Just Don't Use It for Anything Important"** - A tongue-in-cheek commentary on the inherent challenges and limitations of software reliability.

## Context

These sayings often come up in discussions about software development processes, certification activities, and team collaboration. They represent years of experience working with aviation software and certification standards.
