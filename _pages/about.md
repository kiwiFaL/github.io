# About DO-178C Body of Knowledge

This site provides comprehensive resources, guides, and best practices for aviation software certification under DO-178C standards.

## My Mission

My mission is to simplify the understanding and implementation of DO-178C and related material for aviation software developers, verification engineers, and certification specialists. Too much confusion floats around and this creates inefficiencies or less "safe" software. The key thing to understand is DO-178 is about intended function, which feeds into safety but does not in itself make software safer. Please start with the intended function page as an intro

## Content

The site includes:

- **Wiki**: A comprehensive knowledge base covering all aspects of DO-178C
- **Blog**: Regular articles on best practices, case studies, and industry updates. These posts are really a collection of my work days explaining DO-178 and related aspects to others. I have used this website as a way to collect these discussions and make them available for other engineers.
- **Resources**: Templates, checklists, and tools to assist with certification activities
