  <h2>Welcome to the DO-178C Body of Knowledge</h2>
  <p>
    This site is dedicated to building a comprehensive body of knowledge around DO-178C standards for aviation software certification.
    It's created from my daily work in DO-178C, systems engineering, software engineering, and systems safety.
  </p>
  <p>
    I create posts and wiki pages when I have to explain concepts in my daily work to other engineers, regulators, or certification specialists.
    This approach ensures the content is practical, relevant, and addresses real-world challenges in aviation software certification.
